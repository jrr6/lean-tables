# Brown Benchmark for Table Types in Lean

This project is an implementation of the [Brown Benchmark for Table Types (B2T2)](https://github.com/brownplt/B2T2) in Lean 4. Further documentation is forthcoming; in the meantime, refer to the [B2T2 API specification](https://github.com/brownplt/B2T2/blob/main/TableAPI.md).

Note: because this project began at a time when much of Mathlib had yet to be ported to Lean 4, this project does not depend on Mathlib and is entirely self-contained. Many of its definitions have likely since been added to Mathlib, which may cause conflicts.
